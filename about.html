        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am an analytical thinker and problem solver. I have a passion for applying mathematical/statistical/computational techniques to solve problems in ecology and environmental science. I am particularly interested in spatial ecology, spatial data, pattern formation, carbon dynamics, biodiversity, and ecological disturbances.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have a passion for exposition. I have created several presentations to showcase plots and figures from my projects. I can present to an audience of non-experts, by putting my explanations in layman's terms, or to a panel of experts (for example, a thesis committee).
        </p>
        <p>
            My work and personal life both reflect a love of nature. I enjoy diving into outdoor activities in my free time. Some of my hobbies include hiking, biking, camping, wakesurfing, and snowboarding.

            I am a team player who loves to work with others sharing my interests. If you would like to get in contact with me, click here.
