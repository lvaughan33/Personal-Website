    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    Hi, I'm Luke, the creator of this website. I'm an analytical thinker and problem solver. I have a passion for applying mathematical/statistical/computational techniques to solve problems in ecology and environmental science. I'm particularly interested in spatial ecology, spatial data, pattern formation, carbon dynamics, biodiversity, and ecological disturbances.
    </p>
    <p>        
    I also have a passion for exposition. I have designed several <a class="presentations-link" href="https://lvaughan33.github.io/Personal-Website/presentations.html">presentations</a> to showcase plots and figures from my projects. I can present to an audience of non-experts, by putting my explanations in layman's terms, or to a panel of experts (for example, a thesis committee).
    </p>
    <p>
    My work and personal life both reflect a love of nature. I enjoy diving into outdoor activities in my free time. Some of my hobbies include hiking, biking, camping, wakesurfing, and snowboarding.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm a team player who loves to work with others sharing my interests. If you'd like to get in contact with me, click <a class="contact-link" href="https://lvaughan33.github.io/Personal-Website/contact.html">here</a>.
