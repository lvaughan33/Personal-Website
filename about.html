            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I'm Luke Vaughan, the creator of this website. I'm an analytical thinker and problem solver. I have a passion for applying mathematical/statistical/computational techniques to solve problems in ecology and environmental science. I'm particularly interested in spatial ecology, diffusion, pattern formation, carbon dynamics, biodiversity, and ecological disturbances.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have a passion for exposition. I have designed several <a href="presentations.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #fff;">presentations</a> to showcase plots and figures from my projects. I can present to an audience of non-experts, by putting my explanations in layman's terms, or to a panel of experts, such as a thesis committee.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work and personal life both reflect a love of nature. I enjoy diving into outdoor activities in my free time. Some of my hobbies include hiking, biking, camping, wakesurfing, and snowboarding.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a team player who loves to work with others sharing my interests. If you would like to get in contact with me, click <a href="contact.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #fff;">here</a>.
